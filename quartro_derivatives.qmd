## Derivatives in R

Learning how to find derivatives in R:

```{r}
#we will rarely write expressions
fx = expression( 3.1 * (x ^ 4) - 28 * x )

df_dx = D(fx, 'x')

#this will call it back (show me!)
df_dx

x <- 10

eval(df_dx)
```

Find the slop of g(z) = \@2z^3^-10.5z\^2 + 4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}
gz = expression((2*z^3) - (10.5*z^2) + 4.1)

dg_fz = D(gz, 'z')

z <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)
eval(dg_fz)
```
